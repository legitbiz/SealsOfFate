You must sign a Contribution License Agreement (CLA) before your PR will be merged. This a one-time requirement for Microsoft projects in GitHub. You can read more about Contribution License Agreements (CLA) on Wikipedia.

However, you don't have to do this up-front. You can simply clone, fork, and submit your pull-request as usual.

Signing the CLA is not terrify and can be done in a small amount of time. Ideally, you'd have access to a PDF reader/editor that allows for signing. If not, take a photo of the signature page and email it to <jeremiah@legit.biz>.
